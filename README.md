# UFOs

## Overview
  Dana has been really interested in displaying all this UFO data that has been collected. She wanted to dispaly it on a website and have the viewers of the website able to filter through the data provided to find specific UFO sightings.

## Results:

So we designed a very sleek looking website, and the added many filters, including the Date, City, State, Country, UFO shape, and DUration of the encounter. First you can enter whatever critira you would like into any of the search bars. I decided to demostrate by searching for "ca" the acronym for California.

Then I decided that I had too many results came up, so I added another filter, to only look at incidences that had lights as the shape of the UFO seen.

 There! Only eleven results. So if anyone had seen a specific shape, such as a saucer, and wanted to see if there were other sightings within there state, they can do that.

## Summary: 
  For the future, two things I would add to this website would be: 
    1.videos or images that were taken of the incidents 
    2.a way for visitors to the website to upload their own incidents to add to the database and be searchable.
